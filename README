This is a simple program for not a root user to  executing some sh script as a root user.  

############################### Instruction: ##################################
|- HowToUse:	touch a config file and run xxx.sh xxx.log "argument1" "argument2" ... "argumentn"
|
|- Argument1:	this arg must be a existing sh script file
|
|- Argument2:	this arg is a option for log file
|
|- Argumentn:	except arg1 and arg2, the others are option for sh argument
|
|- ErrCodeDesc:	1 sh file not exist; 2 file cannot be executed; 3 not a sh file; 4 not a config sh file; 5 no config file.
|
|- DefaultlLog:	default log file is current dir's run.log
|
|- ShWarning:	the offering sh script should validate all the arguments before use it
|
|- AuthWarning: make sure php process cannot change config file and sh file which was written in config.


important:
	1 make sure the task producer [maybe php process]  have no auth to change config file and the sh script file.

	2 make sure the sh script file will not use the argument as a cmd or no illeagle validation before use it as a cmd.  
example:
	1 cc.sh file content:
	#!/bin/bash
	echo 233
	echo $1
	echo $2
	echo $3
	
	2 here some examples:
	[root@test run]# ./bin/run ./cc.sh run.log rm -rf /
	233
	rm
	-rf
	/
	[root@test run]# ./bin/run ./cc.sh run.log "test || rm -rf / || ls"  "rm -rf /" "test && rm -rf /" 
	233
	test || rm -rf / || ls
	rm -rf /
	test && rm -rf /
